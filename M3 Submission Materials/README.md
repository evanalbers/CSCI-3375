# *The Road Less Turtled*

* AUTHOR: Evan Albers
* DUE DATE: 15 September 2022
* PROJECT: M3 - The Road Less Turtled

****

## Setup
The setup is fairly straightforward. To run *The Road Less Turtled*, simply open a terminal window and run a command line command of the form `python3 M3.py [x]` where x is an int greater than one. A window will pop up, and a legion of turtles will go to work. Simply quit the process when satisfied with their work.

## Artistic Context
One of my favorite poems is "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost. Especially throughout my college years, where I've made a series of decisions that will probably play out across my whole life (major, internship decisions, etc.), it is easy to think about choices not made,
and dwell on where they might have lead. In particular, I think about making choices that are against the grain of what others have typically done; one example is how I've spent most of my summers rowing, instead of finding work. I'm fortunate to be able to do it in the first place, but it represents a bit of a risk, especially if it means other future oppurtunities might suffer for a lack of a more productive use of that time. Despite this, I don't regret it. There is a passage in "The Road Not Taken" that speaks to me in this light:

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
>And sorry I could not travel both
>And be one traveler, long I stood
>And looked down one as far as I could
>To where it bent in the undergrowth;
>
>Then took the other, as just as fair,
>And having perhaps the better claim,
>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
